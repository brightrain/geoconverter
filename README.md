geoconverter
============

A simple interface to convert data between geojson and arcjson using the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/geojson-utils">esri geojson-utils js tool</a>. There is also some commented out but roughed-in components for displaying the results of the geojson to arcjson (polygons) on a map via arcgis online.
