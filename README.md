geoconverter
============

A simple interface to convert data between geojson and arcjson using the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/geojson-utils">esri geojson-utils js tool</a>. Currently the only interface is for conversion from geojson to arcjson but the html and js to go the other way are commented out. There is also a feature to display the converted arcjson on a map but it is also commented out until the map janks can be worked out.
